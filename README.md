# HEX: A Revolution in Finance or Crypto's Latest Scam?
![hex](https://miro.medium.com/max/6624/1*snVJOH5YE5W3MStwDkO8Wg.png)
## Overview and Origin

* **What is the name of the company?**
<br/>The name of the cryptocurrency I am researching is HEX. It is not a company and has no owner, rather it is code living on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **When was the company incorporated?**
<br/>The cryptocurrency token was launched on December 2, 2019 (coinincodex.com).
* **Who are the founders of the company?**
<br/>The founder of this cryptocurrency is Richard Heart. A retired serial entrepeneur who got into Bitcoin in 2011 (YouTube).
* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
<br/>HEX came to fruition after years of understanding cryptocurrency and what blockchain can do. Heart knew what Bitcoin was good for but also saw its limitations. He crafted a cryptocurrency that innovates Bitcoin while also remaining within the founding principles of cryptocurrency.
* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
<br/>The cryptocurrency had a launch phase of 353 days in which Bitcoin holders could claim for free and people could transform Ethereum into HEX. It was calculated that the transform ETH into HEX address recieved about four million Ethereum (YouTube). This address is no longer in use. The only way the Originating Address of HEX (different from previous) recieves funding is when stakes are ended prematurely and half the penalty goes to the Origin Address and the other half goes to the rest of the stakers (hex.com)

## Business Activities

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
<br/>The financial problem HEX solves is trustless yield. HEX is an immutable smart contract that allows you to hold your own keys while earning yield. In the cryptocurrency space, everyone loves more coins. They give up their coins to third party entities who promise yield. These third party entities take your keys and usually end up losing all your money. Block-Fi, Celsius, Terra, to name a few yield generating protocols that have gone bankrupt in the last year and ended up losing all their users money. HEX allows you to earn yield on your HEX with no middlemen, just you and the code. HEX is also not a security since you are earning your own rewards.
* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
<br/>HEX's intended customer is a human with an internet connection. Cryptocurrency was created to remove middlemen, to have censorship-resistance, and to ease the transfer of value. HEX does all these things and is truly the pinnacle of decentralized finance. With financial uncertantity rising in the world, more people will be inclined to choose HEX for its securitiy, performance, and features. 
HEX has 310,552 Ethereum addresses holding it with a market cap of $19 billion (etherscan.io).
HEX has 109,646 current stakers, locking up $2.13 billion in HEX (hexdailystats.com).

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
<br/>HEX monetizes time. HEX was made to be a better Bitcoin. In both Bitcoin and HEX, the supplies of the currencies inflate. New inflation in Bitcoin is given to the miners in exchange for securing the network. These miners have two large negative externalities being electricity and mining hardware. They have to sell the new inflation they get in order to pay the bills. Contrary to Bitcoin, the HEX code will always run by itself and it does not have a kill switch. In HEX, stakers get the new inflation. There are no negative externalities in HEX so there is no necessary need to sell. The only thing you trade for more HEX is time. The longer you stake, the more interest you recieve (like a CD). HEX monetizes time by introducing the abilitiy to trustlessly earn yield in exchange for waiting. HEX provides the same store of value, censorship-resistant option as Bitcoin, but with better features. It is hard to time when to buy and when to sell assets. HEX incentivizes you to hold your crypto through runs and their retracements. Since cryptocurrency has a strong use case and has little adoption at the moment, it can be said it will be more valuable in the future.
* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)**
<br/>HEX utilizes Ethereum's turing completeness by performing computational fluid dynamics (YouTube). To simulate compounding interest in HEX, it will always cost more HEX to get the same amount of shares as you had in your previous stake. This is done by the HEX code trustlessly. HEX also simulates a CD at the bank by allowing you to lock up any amount of HEX you want for 1-5555 days in exchange for interest. HEX calculates you more shares the more HEX you choose to lock and the longer you choose to lock for (hex.com).

## Landscape

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
<br/>HEX is a cryptocurrency application on the Ethereum blockchain, however I'd say that it could fall under a new category called "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)" as well. 
* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?**
<br/>Some major trends of blockchain and cryptocurrencies have been scams, memes, decentralized finance, NFTs, privacy, and central banks digital currencies. Scams ran rampant on Ethereum when it launched as ICOs. Memes made their way into cryptocurrency with Dogecoin and have stuck around as a major reason people are in crypto at all. Decentralized finance becomes more of a trend as the world gets scarier. It came to forefront as our privacy was taken away by the US government sanctioning Tornado.cash. All this leads into the latest trend of CBDCs and how they will impact the crypto and the rest of the world. Some innovations have been Proof-of-Stake blockchains not only being viable, but outperforming Proof-of-Work, causing far less pollution and destruction of the environment. Also, there is a decentralized market maker called Uniswap that is an open-source application that allows for people to exchange coins without the need for a centralized entitiy controlling it and has some of the thickest orderbooks in all of cryptocurrency. Another innovation is Tornado.cash, another decentralized, open-source application that allows for guarenteed privacy and anonimity for its users. This was so innovative, the US Government had to sanction it.
* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
<br/>The other major cryptocurrencies that HEX competes with are mainly Bitcoin and somewhat Ethereum. HEX competes with Bitcoin directly as they both address being a censorship-resistant, store of value tool on the blockchain. HEX somewhat competes with Ethereum in price speculation and market cap dominance. HEX was at one point 80% of the Ethereum market cap (coinmarketcap.com). Other large players in the domain are Circle who control the stablecoin USDC and Tether who control the stablecoin USDT. These coins function as 1:1 value to the real US dollar.

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
<br/>HEX has certainly made a splash in the cryptocurrency arena. HEX was labeled as a scam before launch due to factors like, it being designed to go up 1,000,000% in 2.5 years, the founder was a Bitcoin maximalist and now liked Ethereum more, or it inflating for "no reason". HEX went on to actually go up 1,000,000%+ in 623 days. On top of that, HEX is a finished product with immutable code, it was carefully designed around SEC security laws, has most of its liquidity available only on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, and has worked flawlessly so far. People are building on top of HEX, creating smart contracts that allow for you to tokenize your HEX stake and list it on OpenSea as an NFT for sale (hedron.pro). Or creating big staking pools with a token that represents the value of your share of the community HEX stake that you can sell whenever (maximusdao.com). HEX's success has caused many people who were wrong about HEX, to continue to be intellectually dishonest and mislead their followers further, hurting everyone involved. HEX has shaken up the cryptocurrency community as a product labeled by some, too good to possibly be true. HEX has created a line in the sand. You either love HEX or you hate it. HEX also popularized staking in cryptocurrency. HEX's business impact has been to cause competitors to lie about and copy it in order to keep up with it.
* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
<br/>Some core metrics any cryptocurrency looks at are have there been any bugs/critical vulnerabilities, are more people joining or leaving, is the function of the cryptocurrency getting better or worse, and the price.
HEX has not had any bugs or mishaps so far. According to hexdailystats.com, HEX has been growing as the number of current stakers hasn't decreased in the past 250+ days. Meaning HEX is onboarding more new users that actually use HEX more than it is losing old ones. Next, the function of HEX is to stake HEX. A way to measure the health of HEX is the average stake length. The average stake length in HEX is 6.65 years and it has only been going up, for reference, 300 days ago the average stake length was 5.93 years (hexdailystats.com). Finally, HEX right now is down 95% from its all time high, which is not good but some would view this as an opportunity, since it is a great time to accumulate HEX relatively cheap. 
* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
<br/>Many cryptocurrencies have had major bugs and mishaps in their lifetime, Bitcoin has had two inflation bugs and Ethereum had to roll-back their chain once . HEX is outperforming in the security metric. It is nearly impossible to keep track of Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining/losing users because a lot of people hold their coins with centralized exchanges. I assume Bitcoin and Ethereum are onboarding new users as HEX is. As far as function goes in Bitcoin, it has not really progressed. Bitcoin miners disuade people from building on the network because it clogs it up and the code is feeble and people don't want to upgrade it because they end up breaking it. Ethereum has been constantly improving itself, whether it be with zK-roll ups, EIP-1599, or the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake security model. Ethereum has the most developers in cryptocurrency and encourage growth and innovation. The HEX ecosystem has also had innovation, just not as much as Ethereum, but more than Bitcoin despite being out for less time. Bitcoin's price went down 75% from all time high, Ethereum's price went down 85% from all time high and HEX's price went down 95% from all time high. If you have to endure dips anyways, why not endure it with the coin that is going to go up the hardest when it is time and is the only one paying you trustless yield.

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
<br/>I would suggest they offer a HEX 101 training course with incentives. Create simple, in laymans terms videos people can watch for free that teach them what crypto is, why it's important, what HEX is and how to buy. If they complete the course they get some free HEX. If HEX starts performing well, those with free HEX will see that and often buy more. 
* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
<br/>If you want to learn what HEX is, you either have to read words on the website or watch community YouTube videos. Both of which, use sophisticated language that a new user has a hard time understanding. This often disuades people from learning more because they feel already inadequate. 
* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
<br/>This service would have to incorporate blockchain technology since people are rewarded with HEX for completion. It would also probably utilize code that keeps track of people who complete the course. HEX's main ethos is to remove middlemen so this code would have to be automated. I would see if it were possible to publicly store the people who complete the course and their given address and then be able to have a public call function anyone could call they would just have to pay for the gas fee. When the button is pressed, the addresses are pushed to a multiple-address crypto deployer and the HEX is sent out from a reserve wallet. 
* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
<br/>These technologies are appropriate because they assist in providing the necessary tools in rewarding new users with HEX while mainting the integrity and principles of HEX.
